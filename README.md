Build an Accessible Image Gallery

got images showing OK, and thumbnails lookingOK.

switching ok of media, change to less than 600px

got html buttons working

got keyboard arrows working (split code off to functions to do all options of go left / go right)

added in aria labels for html items without them.

added in more images, but now thumbnails not showing all in scrolling thumbnail bar

unable to sort that seems to show most, but not all. sometimes appear to be hidden so can click on other images not show!!??

need help with that.
